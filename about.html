    <h1>Introducing EOB: Engineer On Board - Remote Support Made Easy with Pro Control</h1>
    <p> 
      Welcome to the 'About EOB' page of Pro Control, where we introduce our product EOB. EOB stands for 'Engineer On Board' and is an innovative product that enables remote support to be provided in a fast, efficient and secure manner.
      <br><br>
      At Pro Control we believe that every organization, large or small, deserves the best technical support. With the EOB it is possible to have an engineer on board remotely, without the need for a physical presence. This offers many advantages, including saving time and money for both the engineer and the employee on site.
      <br><br>
      The EOB is designed with the latest technologies, including a camera, microphone and box, and a chat function. With these functions, an engineer can remotely control the employee on site and watch them solve technical problems. All this is done via a secure and reliable connection, which always guarantees the privacy of the users.
      <br><br>
      At Pro Control we have paid a lot of attention to the user-friendliness of the EOB. The product is intuitively designed, making it easy for anyone to use. This makes the EOB an ideal solution for organizations that need technical support quickly, where physical contact is not an option.
      <br><br>
      We are proud to offer EOB to our customers, and we are confident that it will become an indispensable tool for any organization working remotely. We continue to innovate and improve so that we can always offer the best solutions for our customers.
      <br><br>
      Thank you for your interest in Pro Control and our EOB. For more information or questions you can always contact us.

    <h1>Safe way of <span>working</span></h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      Although the EOB works remotely, it is a safe way, protecting the interests of the customer and the service engineer.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-sw">
      <li>The EOB is a box with a touch screen that can only be placed on location at the desired time in case of calamities and can be removed when the problem has been solved</li>
      <li>It works independently of the corporate network, so the corporate network cannot be hacked through the EOB</li>
      <li>The EOB also works when no computer is present</li>
      <li>The EOB is very user-friendly; no software needs to be installed anywhere</li>
      <li>The EOB is robust and can be placed anywhere</li>
      <li>Only one EOB is needed per location</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="ease-of-use">
    <h1><span>Ease of use</span></h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      In the event of an emergency, the EOB is taken and placed on the desk. A plug in the socket, plug a camera into the box and log in via WiFi (use Guest WiFi). That's all it takes to connect. The box can be placed anywhere, provided there is power nearby and a reasonable reception.
      The EOB can be used for several machines or departments. Assuming that there are no faults on several systems at the same time.
    </p> 
  </div>

  <div class="subs">
    <h1><span>Subscription</span></h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      The EOB works according to a subscription structure. When the subscription is taken out, the EOB will be sent and a monthly subscription fee will be debited.
      The subscription that has been taken out is not automatically renewed. However: if at the end of the subscription period the EOB has not been returned within one month after termination, the subscription will be extended for the same subscription period, with retroactive effect.
